### Justifications for Apollo 11
 
This section added for teams to use as a template for Evaluation 3.  You should state the level that you wish to get, as well as a justification that consists of what you did to satisfy the minimum requirements for that achievement, against the details in Post @159).

Our team proposes that we should be granted Project Gemini (Intermediate) level of achievement.
As you can see from our log we have been active over all three months of the project and have a record of sustained contribution to our Orbital project.  We have completed Liftoff, and met each other on and off through the months to develop our web application using the recommended Google App Engine using Python.
 
With respect to Mission Control topics, Min attended one session physically, while Wee Sun watched two sessions.  We have used some of the technologies (Bootstrap, Maps API) in our project, but have also watched the Unit Testing sesion although that hasn't made it into our project.
 
With respect to Peer evaluation, we have tried our best to give constructive feedback in the free-text fields, going beyond the minimum requirement for offering feedback to you, our peers. Hopefully you will agree and grant us a minimum of 2.5 / 4 stars for feedback from you. We're hoping for your 3 or 4 ratings for the peer feedback evaluation.
For the four additional features on top of the basic project we would like our peers and the instruction staff to consider the following for the criteria for Project Gemini (culled from Post @159). Hopefully this grants us the 2.5/4 minimum from all of you (please?):
路       Added Facebook system for sending thank yous (as like button by the receiving party): counts again Social integration (see e.g. https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/).
 
路       Google Login: counts against Facebook or OpenID login (other than that provided automatically by Google App Engine), see e.g. https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login,https://developers.google.com/appengine/articles/openid.
 
路       Added pins and local maps for events: counts against Google Maps API https://developers.google.com/maps/, or OneMap API http://www.onemap.sg/api/help/.
 
路       Adding in auto-suggested pictures for gifts via querying Google Image against the user's description of the gift: counts against Other features.
 
We wished to have been able to complete some form of user testing but we ran out of time. We hope to poll more friends as they return to school at Week 0 and 1 for this, but we understand that this cannot be counted as the project is officially over with Evaluation 3 :-( Oh well.
