# Sample README and log for Orbital 2015

I made a readme and log sample based on the first milestone requirement in markdown format.
Feel free use it to kick start your documentation.

### DISCLAIMER
This sample should only be used as a guideline.<br>
I have tried, to the best of my abilities, to ensure that all requirements are met when using this sample.<br>
That said, it is **your responsibility** to ensure that your readme and log fit the requirements
set out by orbital. I am in no way a mentor, advisor or like (just another participant like you!). 
If you find any mistake feel free to open an issue or DM me on [slack (@geraldng)][] or even better make a pull request! :D
